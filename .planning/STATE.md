# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-10) and .planning/milestones/ for the archived v1.0–v1.3 records.

**Core value:** Every adversarial claim hardens into scoped, receipt-backed, retestable evidence.
**Current focus:** Between milestones — v1.3 shipped; scope for the next milestone unchosen

## Current Position

Phase: none (no active milestone)
Status: v1.3 archived 2026-10-10 (audit: tech_debt, same no-gaps classification as v1.2)
Next: choose the next milestone scope (candidates in `.planning/v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` tech-debt list)

## Completed Context

- **v1.0** 2026-10-09: plan-based inference, Dark Purple core, white/red UI, Grok Bot package.
- **v1.1** 2026-10-09: six specialist hats, Grok slash grammar, UI polish, Tauri scaffold.
- **v1.2** 2026-10-10 (tag `v1.2`): re-home (MIT), Tauri bundle completion, node22 sidecar, remote-access hardening.
- **v1.3** 2026-10-10 (`f654ea1`→`4c37232`): color suites at red parity — `detection`/`emulation`/`governance` catalog categories (+12 adapters, 120 total, pins kept honest); D3FEND + ATT&CK v19.2 vendors (attributed); blue/black/white engine suites; three corpus+judge benches (detection 4/4, opsec 6/6, roe 6/6 — deterministic, CI-pinned, decoy-penalized); four playbooks (defense 20, tradecraft 20, adjudication 18); nine color routes; purple v2 id-keyed synthesis + riskTier + persistence; `docs/defend.html`; MCP 12 tools. Full gates at close: lint 0 errors, typecheck clean, 1103 tests / 100 files, doctor, prompt audit 39/39.

## Pending Todos

- Owner decision: next milestone scope.

## Blockers/Concerns

- v1.3 tech debt (accepted, in the audit): no phase VERIFICATION files; ROE verdicts-on-record need a ROE text source; residualRisk prose/riskTier duplication; installer matrix CI-only; docker healthcheck unrun.

## Session Continuity
